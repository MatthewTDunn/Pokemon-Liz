<br />
A project I spear headed in 2020 as a present to my wife's (then girlfriend) 30th birthday. Utilising the <a target="_blank" href="https://reliccastle.com/essentials/">Pokemon Essentials</a>
development framework as a base, I created a storyline based on her friends/family and life to this point.
<br />

To further enrich the story and personalise the game, I developed and modified a multitude of ruby scripts some of which have been 
outlined below. 
<ul>
  <li>Developed a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Pyr1te/Pokemon-Liz/blob/main/Scripts/MD_PokeGallery.rb">photo gallery</a> that can be accessed through player menu & builds up throughout the game and NPC interactions.</li>
  <li>Unique rideable Pokemon</li>
  <li>Level/Name dependent Pokemon party deletion/addition</li>
</ul>

## How It's Made:

Employing the <a href="https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-xp">RPGMaker XP</a> development engine and <a target="_blank" href="https://reliccastle.com/essentials/">Pokemon Essentials</a> 
framework, this game was created in approximately 5 months. With the benefit of a comprehensive framework underpinning the basic functionality of the game, I was able
to focus on ruby extensions, personalising code specific to the story being told and town/character design.
<br />
<br />
With a clear goal in mind and desire to make it unique to my wife, I sub-contracted artists to assist in asset development:

</ul>

## Lessons Learned:

Transitioning a medium scale project from an idea to reality brought along many unexpected issues. From handling a small team of people
contributing to the asset development in a freelance capacity to pressures around a looming deadline, taking this project from start to finish was a difficult and
very rewarding project.
<br />
<br />
As this project proceeded, allocating resources and time to certain components was tightened up from a better understanding of the software and end goal, however 
in the beginning an unrealistic final product was persued that ended up wasting time and money for components that were undeliverable. 
<br />
<br />
A primary take away from this project is the importance of having a minimum viable product (MVP) without the 'bells and whistles' outlined from the start. Additionally 
a better understanding of the software and tools required to make a project work and approximate time frame for component level development would have assisted in the beginning and 
unfortunately was disregarded initially in this project.
